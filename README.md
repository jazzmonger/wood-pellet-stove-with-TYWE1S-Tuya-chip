This project dives deep into the TuyaMCU parts of ESPHome that can be used to control various Tuya cloud based pellet stoves.  While the ESPHome TuyaMCU implementation is mostly robust, getting information on what it does and how it does it and why has been challenging to say the least.  I hope this helps someone else. I now have two of these stoves running ESPHome and FINALLY they function the way I want them to, not how some idiotic low-budget coder tried to program them.  I used to wake up cursing my pellet stoves.  Now I just wake up all warm and fuzzy.

The Advanced version completely replaces the Tuya Wifi module with an ESP32 D1 Mini chip and adds a whole new world of control to these stoves.

TuyaMCU Docs: https://esphome.io/components/tuya.html

The Tuya TYWE1S chips and those like it are basically just repackaged ESP8266 modules.  All the functions of the 8266 are all there.  The TuyaMCU libray in ESPHome provides an abstraction layer between the display/control module and Home Assistant. It allows control messages to be both Sent and Received from the device the module is controlling. In this case, our stove's main brain/control unit, or MCU as its called.

I'm an electronic engineer/designer by education and training, not a professional programmer, but thankfully ESPHome makes all this pretty easy. That said, I LOVE hacking this stuff, so  start with replacing the buggy, error prone Tuya control software by flashing ESPHome onto the display's TYE1S Tuya communications & controller chip.

**Product Models:** 
Cleveland Ironworks Wood Pellet Stove (there are 4 models, all use the same controller).  
https://www.cleveland-ironworks.com/products/pellet-stoves.html
I have a test bench set up with a spare control board. i have 2 models of this stove which both fail, but for different reasons.

It also appears from the Wifi module (N12210) that this exact same controller is used in Nemaxx Pellet Stove Pellet Heater P6 P9 P12.  https://www.ebay.com/itm/193755684864

Masterforge has the exact same models of this stove, all will use the same controller.

There are several others sold by Lowes, and other retailers that use the same display control board and TYWE1S chip.

There are a few displays that look slightly different but I believe all have the same basic internals. The displays have exactly the same function, just dufferent color faceplates. if they look like any of these then youre in luck!
All will have a TYWE1S chip that provide wifi functions that can be reprogrammed with ESPHome.

UPDATE: if the chip is the blue D1 Mini on the daughterboard, and the app you use is "Fire@home" and you got the stove in the EU, the stove uses the Blynk protocol, not Tuya.  We've exhausted all options trying to get this working. see the discussions. I would need the actual display board from this stove to decode the protocol being used

The wood stoves work ok some of the time, but the stove malfunctions fairly frequently.  
Common mafunctions include:
- randomly turning off w/ the msg "Goodbye!" on the display.
- pellets failing to light in the hopper
- not coming back on after power failure
- various cryptic E messages from time to time. E1,E2,ESC1, ESO1,ESC2,ESO2,etc  
- the stove will overheat when set to ECO2 and P1, throwing ESC1 errors. mitigate this with a fan behind the stove, triggered by exhaust temp.  set combustion fan to -10 for P1 in stove settings. 
Putting a fan behind the stove also fixes E6 error code indicating the temp sensor below the pellet hopper is reading too high

**Basic Problem Definition**
Pellet stoves made by Cleveland Ironworks all use the TuyaMCU chip TYWE1S to communicate with the stove's MCU inside the display unit.  Their shoddy programmer defined multiple datapoints for the same attribute in at least 2 cases, the most important being temperature.  This results in the Tuya integration reporting a random (usually negative) false value for current temp. The other problem is it sends its temp values as degrees F and ALL esphome climate entities originate in C.  If you set your HA instance to imperial, it will automagically convert C to F.  In this case it convering what it thinks is C ( but is really F) into F again.  temp readings are whacked and there was nothing you can do until now.

Their app is a vendor written Tuya based app that looks like this:

Simply flashing esphome to the chip gives incorrect temp readings due to the stove using F instead of C for values. a fix for this is coming (update: its fixed).  The stove below might work great in purgatory (which, Im sure, is where these stoves were built), but not in the real world...

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52110065/201826977-369853d6-650e-4048-9e9a-6701e3d1621c.png" width="200">

also, the main problem with trying to control the stove by brute force by manually controlling everything in ESPHome is setting your target temp doesn't work bc it fights with the stove's internal "set temp" that is set thru the front panel. when the room temp sensor reaches the user set value it shuts off to stove - its all a self contained system. The daughterbiard w/ the TYWE1S is only there to provide wifi support.  There there is no way to convert the stove control fully to to ESPHome. too many sensors, blowers, igniters, relays and safety issues to etc to deal with. This is all best left to the dusplay and main MCU control board. But we can secretly (and safely) intervene...

**Solution**
- Flash ESPHome to the TWYE1S daughterbiard chip using TuyaMCU. This is the module that normally relays info to and from the stoves control board and also provides a WiFi control interface to the Tuya iOT China based cloud platform. ESPHome eliiminates China from the equation and gives you local, Home Assistant control.
- use the new mod I got one of the ESPhome devs to make for me and you're golden.  its defined in the esphome config file.
- if your stove is turning off for no reason w/ "Goodbye" displayed on the screen, then the automations I've provided should help mitigate this
- go a step further and make a few *very* simple mods to the display and control board and you get FULL control over this stove WITHOUT sacraficing any of the safety features built into this stove.

See the Discussions for specific solutions to some of the errors and problems I've solved over the past year of doing battle with this stove. Its in the Discussions where I show the deep mods that are available and really make this Pellet Stove shine.

Post a message in the Discussions for basic questions or create a PR (problem report) if you are doing mods to your stove and run into issues.  I've tried to be as complete as possible and probably seen every problem these stoves have and then some.
Have fun!

**Data Points used by TuyaMCU and Tuya cloud:**
```
1 - Power on (Heat)
4 - Mode P1/P2/P3P4
101 - ECO1/ECO2
104 - Error Code
105 - random, unused
106 - Set desired room Temp
107 - Current Temp
108 - Pipe Temp
109 - Protect Temp
```
Error code is dp 104 (these come back from the server as numbers and are then mapped to error codes in the vendor app).  See my sensors.yaml file for how to decode them.

*Flashing the chip*
Carefully remove it from the display module.  It unplugs easily. or leave it in the display and use the power from the display to power the chip.  Ive done it both ways, either is fine.

this link shows you how to do it: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU-Devices/#costco-charging-essentials

EDIT: for future reference, if unplugging the module from the display, I used 3.3v from the FTTD adapter to power the TYWE1S, U0TX (goes to RX on the FTTD adapter)  and U0RX (goes to TX on the FTTD adapter) then I only grounded GPIO0 at bootup to flash the chip.  Remove this ground from GPIO0 after its flashed and restart the chip. Also, connect 3.3V (not 5v) to the 3V3 pin on the TYWE1S chip, pin 4, or just leave the module plugged in and use the stove to power the chip.

WARNING - be careful when you solder wires to the board/chip to flash the chip.  I used breadbord wires w/pins and my VCC connection broke at some point and it took most of the circuit board trace off both the board AND the chip.  I salvaged it with a Frankenstein jumper, but you've been warned! Just be careful when handlin, use long wires and you should be fine.

My "Ultimate" Pellet Stove Command Module after completely replacing the wifi module and Tuya chip with an ESP32 D1 mini. Yes, it can be done.



Another piece of the puzzle was to snoop on the RX UART line going from the display to the MCU control board.  this lets you echo messages from the display to home assistant as there is no other way to do it. its a little flakey at times (its just display messages), but mostly works. See the discussions section on how i achieved this bit of UART magic!

And finally, while i have had the stove burn for 2-3 days straight, it does go out if the ultra-low burn pot settings arent just right.  So, in the "Ultimate vesion" I add a wire to monitor the UART messages from the main MCU that contain temp updates so I can measure realtime temp updates (instead of at 1 min intervals via the Tuya crap). This helps to better control the burn pot and keep the fire from going out when on "Ultra Low" setting. Again, see Discussions for more info.
